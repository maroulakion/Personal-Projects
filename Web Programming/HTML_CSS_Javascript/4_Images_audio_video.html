    <!--AUDIO-->
    <hr><h2>Importing audio</h2><hr>
    <h4>Adding audio</h4> <ul>
    <li>Audio from Youtube library (saved on subfolder). It uses the "controls" attribute to play, pause, and adjust volume and speed. Try it!: <br>
        <audio controls src="assets/Old World Saga - Hanu Dixit.mp3"></li>
    <li>Same audio, with "muted" and "controls" attributes, the default (when page loads) of music is muted but plays when Play button is pressed: <br>
        <audio controls muted src="assets/Old World Saga - Hanu Dixit.mp3"></li>
    <li>This audio uses the "loop" and "controls" attributes, so when press to play and finishes, it restarts (until pause is hit): <br>
        <audio loop controls src="assets/Old World Saga - Hanu Dixit.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></li>
    <li>The attribute "autoplay" starts music when page loads. It can be combined with "loop" to always keep playing on background.</li></ul>
    
    <h4>Error catching on audio</h4> <ul>
    <li>In case browser doesn't support this audio format, don't make the audio tag as self-closing, and add a source tag with error message in it. 
        In this, you can also try other back-up audios in cases the primary fails.
        If you can see/play this audio with no problem, your browser support its format.</li>
    <audio controls>
        <source src="assets/Old World Saga - Hanu Dixit.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        <source src="assets/Old World Saga - Hanu Dixit.wav">
        Your browser doesn't support this audio element.
    </audio></ul>

    <!--VIDEOS-->
    <hr><h2>Importing videos</h2><hr>
    <h4>Adding video</h4> <ul>
    <li>Video from ShutterStock (saved on subfolder). It uses the "loop" and "controls" attributes to play, pause, and adjust volume and speed. When finished, it automatically restarts. Try it!: <br>
        <video controls autoplay src="assets/dragon_screaming.mp4"></li>
    <li>Of course, the attributes "muted", "autoplay" can also be used.</li>
    <li>...Re-adjust size with "width" and "height":<br>
        <video muted autoplay loop controls src="assets/dragon_screaming.mp4" width="200" height="130"></li></ul>
    
    <h4>Error catching on audio</h4> <ul>
    <li>In case browser doesn't support this video format, don't make the video tag as self-closing, and add a source tag with error message in it. 
        In this, you can also try other back-up videos in cases the primary fails.
        If you can see/play this audio with no problem, your browser support its format.</li><br>
    <video controls width="200" height="130">
        <source src="assets/dragon_screaming.mp4">
        <source src="assets/dragon_screaming.WebM">
        Your browser doesn't support this video element.
