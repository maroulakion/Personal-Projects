LOGIN FORM (WEBSITE - WITH BACKEND)
-----------------------------------
Here is a login form that asks for Username, Email, and Password. 
It includes:
-> HTML for website's structure, 
-> CSS for styling, 
-> Javascript for validity check, and 
-> PHP for checking data on "data base".

Due to the fact I don't actually have any database connected: 
1) you can run on localhost
   -> download XAMPP, 
      save unzipped folder (login_form) on C:\xampp\htdocs\login_form (if using Windows),
      turn on Apache server on XAMPP,
      open browser and type:
             http://localhost/...
      Here, for example, it would need to look something like
             http://localhost/login_form/login_form.html
2) For simplicity and testing purposes, THE ONLY acceptable login data is
    -> "test" as Username
    -> anything as Email (if passing the javascript validity test)
    -> "password" as Password
