SCORE COUNTER (WEBSITE)
-----------------------------
This is a simple page of keeping track of 2-players score.
We consider as winner whoever reaches first 5 points (to gain a point, you press a button). 
The purpose is to show usage of button in Javascript, 
and also remembering to disable them when the winning point is reached. 
There is also a "closure", meaning a function that returns function.
