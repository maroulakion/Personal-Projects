This folder contains .ipynb files with Qiskit code, an open-source framework by IMB to simulate quantum experiments. 
To use Qiskit, basic Python knowledge is required. 
Here, you can find some of my work. Some files aim to provide a compact documentation of Qiskit, and others are more spesific implementations.  

Enjoy!
