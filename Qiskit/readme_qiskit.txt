This folder contains .ipynb files with Qiskit code, an open-source framework by IMB to simulate quantum experiments. 
To use Qiskit, basic Python knowledge is required. 
Here, you can find some of my work. Some files aim to provide a compact documentation of Qiskit, and others are more spesific implementations.  

THE EASIEST WAY to run Qiskit is via IBM Quantum Lab. 
The only requirement is to have/ create an account and import these files on the lab. 
BE SURE to execute inclusion of libraries at the top of each file, and other possible functions bellow that.
