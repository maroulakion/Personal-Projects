This sub-folder contains a compact documentation of Qiskit methods. 
Most of the examples are not a specific implementation of a purposeful algorithm, rather than simple applications of tools provided by Qiskit. 

THE EASIEST WAY to run Qiskit is via IBM Quantum Lab. 
The only requirement is to have/ create an account and import these files on the lab. 
BE SURE to execute inclusion of libraries at the top of each file, and other possible functions bellow that.
