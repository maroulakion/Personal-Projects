# Personal-Projects
Here you can find some of the projects I made in my spare time for fun!

Those include coding in C, Java, Python 
and also some more specific programming: Arduino (for robotics) and use of the Qiskit library (for quantum computing simulation). 
I have also added usage of web technologies, like HTML, CSS, Javascript and also some simple websites created on WordPress (free version only).
